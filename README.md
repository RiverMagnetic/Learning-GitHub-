# Learning-GitHub-
I am new to coding. So far I have been using GitHub only through courses and workshops, learning coding without learning much about GitHub. I've been using it without really understanding how it works! I am creating this repository in hopes that the process of doing so will help me learn how to use GitHub intentionally.  
At the moment, I'm learning how to make and commit changes!
